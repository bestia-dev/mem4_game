It is fun to play only on smartphones. It works in all modern browsers.  
All the players must open this web app to allow communication.  
Put all the smartphones on the table near each other, so all players can see them and touch \
them. It should look like a board game at this point.  
The first player clicks on 'Invite for play?'.  
He can choose different types of game visuals: alphabet, animal, playing cards,...  
Other players then see on the screen 'Click here to Accept play!'.  
Player1 sees how many players have accepted. Then he starts the game.  
On the screen under the grid are clear signals which player plays and which waits.  
Player1 flips over two cards with two clicks. This cards can be on any smartphone. \
The cards are accompanied by sounds and text on the screen.  
If the cards do not match, the other player clicks on 'Click here to Take your turn' and both cards \
are flipped back face down. Then it is his turn and he clicks to flip over his two cards.  
If the cards match, they are left face up permanently and the player receives a point. He continues \
to play, he opens the next two cards.  
The game is over when all the cards are permanently face up.  
Click on \"Play again?\" to re-start the game.  ";
