Hashtags: #rustlang #game #tutorial  
My projects on Github are more like a tutorial than a finished product: [bestia-dev tutorials](https://github.com/bestia-dev/tutorials_rust_wasm).

## Documentation

Documentation generated from source code:  
<https://bestia-dev.github.io/mem4_game/mem4/index.html>  
The workspace mem4_game is made of:  

1. Wasm/WebAssembly  (for browser) frontend - mem4  
2. web server Warp backend - mem4_server  
3. common structures - mem4_common  

## Info and working game

Read the `Last project`:  
<https://github.com/bestia-dev/mem3_game>  
You can play the game here (hosted on google cloud platform):  
<http://bestia.dev/mem4>  
For exercise I made a Docker image/container for mem4 on the google VM:  
<http://bestia.dev/memdock4>  

## bestia.dev

Google cloud platform does not give any subdomain name for free.  
Google is also a domain registrar and it looks like they are trying to push me to buy their domain.
I had to buy my own domain name bestia.dev from porkbun.com for 12$ per year.

## Cargo make

I prepared some flows and tasks for Cargo make for the workspace.  
`cargo make` - lists the possible available/public flows/tasks  
`cargo make dev` - builds the development version and runs the server and the browser  
`cargo make release` - builds the release version and runs the server and the browser  
`cargo make doc` - build the `/target/docs` folder and copy to the `/docs` folder.  

## cargo crev reviews and advisory

It is recommended to always use [cargo-crev](https://github.com/crev-dev/cargo-crev)  
to verify the trustworthiness of each of your dependencies.  
Please, spread this info.  
On the web use this url to read crate reviews. Example:

## Open-source and free as a beer

My open-source projects are free as a beer (MIT license).  
I just love programming.
